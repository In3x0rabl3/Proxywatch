## [Unreleased] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- ProxyWatch Agent (formerly Beaconhunter) with gRPC streaming ingest and remote kill support.
- Windows service support for the agent (`--install/--start/--stop/--uninstall`).
- Host column in the TUI and per-endpoint remote kill handling.
- Whitelist UI (`w` to add, `W` to manage) with on-disk storage.
- TUI collection screen for BloodHound graph output (output path, duration, roles).
- BloodHound OpenGraph JSON export including Host/User/Process/Endpoint nodes and susp-* edges.
- Queries guide (`queries.md`) with prebuilt Cypher examples.

### Changed
- Default refresh interval set to 250ms for both UI and agent.
- Default UI filter shows only `susp-session`, `susp-beacon`, and `susp-tun` unless `-roles` is set.
- Agent binary renamed to `pwa.exe` and service name updated to ProxyWatch Agent.
- Networking/inspect output consolidated to include TCP/UDP in/out, established, and listeners.
- Collection runs from the TUI instead of CLI flags.
- Build flow uses top-level `make` to output binaries into `dist/`.

### Removed
- One-shot `-once` mode.
- Allowlist/allow-publisher/allow-user/allow-path flags and related behavior.
- JSON logging flags and logger implementation.
- `no-network-activity` role.
- `likely-tunnel` role.

### Fixed
- Remote kill support now routes through the agent stream.
- Default UI no longer highlights allowlisted processes unless explicitly whitelisted.
- BloodHound export metadata to match ingest schema (removed unsupported fields).

### Security
- Automatic TLS/mTLS ingest with per-build trust bundle and certificate-based host identity.
